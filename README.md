# DESIGNS

A collection of designs used for Design of Experiments. Most of these designs are used in my current research, so I've made a quick way to access them by creating this package.

The following designs are currently available in `DESIGNS`

- Selected 2-level fractional factorial designs
- Selected orthogonal arrays
- Definitive screening designs
- Definitive screening composite designs

## Installation

You can get the development version from GitHub:

``` r
install.packages("remotes") # if not installed yet
remotes::install_github("toledo60/DESIGNS")
```

## Future Work

- Add description/citations for designs used in the package
- Add more designs
